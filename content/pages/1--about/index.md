title: About

My name is **Ely Alvarado**. I am a the CTO and cofounder of [Happy the App](https://happythemovement.com), and this is my personal blog.

I've been programming since I was almost 6 years old, when my parents got an Apple IIc computer and I started copying the basic programs from the user manual. Since then, I've been involved in the technology world in different roles: PHP programmer, Linux System Administrator, Asterisx VoIP admin, Java Developer, Ruby/Rails developer, JBoss/J2EE application admin, Technology Architect, Technology Manager and Project Manager.

Right now I'm the CTO/cofounder/lead programmer of my own startup: *Happy the App*, and for the last three years I've been developing the iOS version of the app using Swift over a Ruby on Rails backend. I'm also working on porting it to Android, using Javascript and ReactNative.
